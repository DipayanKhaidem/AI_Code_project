# AI_Code_project
An AI-powered platform combining a Code Generator &amp; Debugger with a Retrieval-Augmented QA Bot. Generates and debugs code from natural language and answers PDF-based questions in English and Manipuri using GPT-3.5/4, FAISS, and translation models.
This project aims to build a unified AI assistant that enhances productivity by automating code generation, debugging, and intelligent document-based question answering. By combining large language models (LLMs) with efficient retrieval systems, this solution allows users to extract meaningful answers from uploaded PDFs and generate accurate code from natural language prompts. The effort is focused on bridging the gap between unstructured document data and accessible knowledge, as well as reducing developer overhead through smart code suggestions. This work contributes to the growing field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), helping make information access faster, multilingual, and context-aware.

The assistant is powered by a hybrid of pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3.5, CodeT5) and retrieval pipelines using FAISS or Chroma. PDFs are parsed and chunked into searchable vectors, allowing real-time query-to-passage mapping. Users can upload documents and ask questions in English or Manipuri, with the bot returning both the answer and the paragraph it was derived from. For the coding module, the system accepts problem statements and generates or debugs code using transformer-based models. Technologies include Python, LangChain, Hugging Face, Sentence Transformers, OpenAI API, PyMuPDF, and optionally React or Flask for the frontend

The final system will deliver a dual-feature application where users can interact with a multilingual Q&A bot grounded in their uploaded documents and a code assistant that supports multiple languages. We expect high accuracy in code generation/debugging and high relevance in document answers. This solution enhances learning, accelerates development, and makes knowledge from static text dynamically useful.
